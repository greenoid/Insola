# Isola Game State Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the game state data structure for the Isola game, which allows UI components to easily retrieve and display the current game state.

## Files Created

### 1. GamePhase.java
An enum that represents the current phase of a player's turn:
- `MOVE_PLAYER`: Player needs to move their position
- `REMOVE_TILE`: Player needs to remove a tile

### 2. GameStatus.java
An enum that represents the current status of the game:
- `ONGOING`: Game is still in progress
- `PLAYER1_WON`: Player 1 has won
- `PLAYER2_WON`: Player 2 has won
- `DRAW`: Game ended in a draw (unlikely in Isola)

### 3. IsolaGameState.java
A class that encapsulates all necessary information for UI consumption:
- `currentPlayer`: Which player needs to make a move
- `gamePhase`: Current phase (MOVE_PLAYER or REMOVE_TILE)
- `boardState`: Current board state
- `gameStatus`: Current game status (ONGOING, PLAYER1_WON, PLAYER2_WON)

## Modifications to Existing Files

### IsolaBoard.java
Added getter methods to access board state information:
- `getBoard()`: Returns a copy of the current board state
- `getPlayer1Row()` and `getPlayer1Col()`: Player 1's position
- `getPlayer2Row()` and `getPlayer2Col()`: Player 2's position

### IsolaGame.java
Added fields and methods to track and expose game state:

1. **Fields Added:**
   - `currentGamePhase`: Tracks the current game phase
   - `gameStatus`: Tracks the current game status

2. **Initialization:**
   - `currentGamePhase` is initialized to `GamePhase.MOVE_PLAYER`
   - `gameStatus` is initialized to `GameStatus.ONGOING`

3. **Game Logic Updates:**
   - In human player section: Set `currentGamePhase` to `MOVE_PLAYER` when moving, and `REMOVE_TILE` when removing a tile
   - In computer player section: Set `currentGamePhase` appropriately during computer's turn
   - When a player is isolated: Set `gameStatus` to the appropriate winner

4. **New Method:**
   - `getGameState()`: Returns an `IsolaGameState` object representing the current state

## Usage Example

```java
// In UI code
IsolaGame game = new IsolaGame();
IsolaGameState state = game.getGameState();

// Check game status
switch (state.getGameStatus()) {
    case ONGOING:
        // Display normal game state
        BoardState boardState = state.getBoardState();
        int currentPlayer = state.getCurrentPlayer();
        GamePhase phase = state.getGamePhase();
        
        // Display appropriate UI based on game phase
        if (phase == GamePhase.MOVE_PLAYER) {
            // Enable player movement controls
        } else if (phase == GamePhase.REMOVE_TILE) {
            // Enable tile removal controls
        }
        break;
    case PLAYER1_WON:
        // Display Player 1 victory message
        break;
    case PLAYER2_WON:
        // Display Player 2 victory message
        break;
}
```

## Benefits of This Implementation

1. **Encapsulation**: All game state information is contained in a single object
2. **UI Agnostic**: Can be used by Swing, web, or any other UI framework
3. **Extensible**: Easy to add new state information if needed
4. **Clear Separation**: Separates game logic from UI concerns
5. **Immutable State**: The game state object can be made immutable for safety

## Testing
The implementation has been designed to work with the existing game logic without changing the core functionality. The game should continue to work as before, but now also provides the ability to query the current state for UI purposes.
